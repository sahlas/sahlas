# QA/Testing Interview Preparation Guide

## Questions to Ask Interviewers

### Testing Fundamentals & Philosophy

**Understanding Their Testing Approach:**
- Is it correct to say that your team begins the testing cycle early? Do you apply unit testing from the start?
- Tell me about your static testing strategies, such as documentation reviews?
- Do your teams use testing approaches such as TDD (Test-Driven Development) or BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)?
- Tell me about the SDLC used on your projects.
- On your team and projects, do you regard early adoption of test automation as highly valuable? If so, why?

**Quality Integration:**
- How does your organization embed "quality first" principles into the overall structure?
- Does each team understand their role in quality throughout the SDLC?
- For every development activity, is there a corresponding testing activity?
- Do testers participate in requirement refinement and design discussions?

### Technical Infrastructure & Process

**Testing Environment & Tools:**
- Tell me about your DevOps infrastructure?
- Is there a QA/Staging environment for system testing integration purposes?
- How soon should automation testing procedures be introduced? What does your automation strategy look like?
- Tell me about your test-related taxonomies? For example, do you have a defect taxonomy that focuses on particular types of testing, like usability?

**Team Structure & Responsibilities:**
- Who on the team handles test design activities? Are all members active in this process?
- As a lead on the team, will it fall to me to ensure that we have sufficient test data and test environments? Tools?
- Who is responsible for capturing bi-directional traceability between test basis, test conditions, test cases, and test procedures?

**Data & Documentation Management:**
- Tell me about the test data requirements - How do you manage test data to support different test conditions and cases?
- What's your approach to failure analysis and defect tracing? How do you handle the workflow from bug discovery to resolution?

## Key Testing Principles Reference

Use these as talking points to demonstrate your knowledge:

1. **Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence**
2. **Exhaustive testing is impossible**
3. **Early testing saves time and money** - Most expensive defects are found post-production
4. **Defects cluster together** - 80% of problems are found in about 20% of code modules
5. **Tests wear out** - Same tests eventually stop finding new bugs; new tests/data needed
6. **Testing is context-dependent** - Especially important in agile/iterative environments
7. **Absence of found bugs â‰  meeting user needs**

## Your Quality Philosophy Statement

*Ready to share when appropriate:*

"Quality first means embedding quality principles into the entire organizational structure. Every team member must understand their role in quality at each SDLC step - from static testing like reviewing PRDs and code PRs, to delivery. Finding defects early through reviews, documentation analysis, and proper testing saves time and money. Everyone is responsible for quality at all levels, and I know how to guide teams through this process."

## Video Media Product Defect Taxonomy

*A structured taxonomy for categorizing and organizing different types of issues in video media products:*

### 1. Functional Defects
Core feature failures where the video product doesn't work as intended.

**Playback Control Failures:**
- Failure to play: Video does not start playback
- Pausing/resuming issues: Video fails to pause or resume correctly
- Seeking/scrubbing errors: Cannot jump to specific timestamp, or player freezes

**Video Rendering Failures:**
- Black screen: Only audio plays, no video visible
- Green screen: Video content replaced by solid green color
- Frozen frame: Video freezes on single frame while audio continues

**Audio Synchronization:**
- Audio/video desync: Audio and video become out of sync during playback
- Missing audio: No sound produced during video playback

**Subtitles and Captions Failures:**
- Missing subtitles: Subtitles not displayed when enabled
- Incorrect timing: Subtitles appear too early or too late
- Formatting errors: Incorrect text size, font, or color
- Language issues: Wrong language displayed for subtitles

**DRM (Digital Rights Management) Failures:**
- Playback blocked: Protected content fails to play due to DRM error
- License acquisition failure: Player cannot obtain necessary content license

### 2. Performance Defects
Issues that degrade user experience by impacting speed, efficiency, and resource consumption.

- **High latency:** Long delays between user action and expected result
- **Buffering issues:** Player frequently stops to load data, causing interruptions
- **Frame rate drops:** Video FPS decreases, causing choppy/stuttering experience
- **High CPU/memory usage:** Excessive system resource consumption
- **Slow loading times:** Videos or UI take too long to load

### 3. Compatibility Defects
Issues when the video product fails to work properly across different environments, devices, or platforms.

- **Device-specific failures:** Works on one device type but fails on another
- **Browser-specific failures:** Works on one browser but not others
- **Resolution/aspect ratio issues:** Video doesn't scale properly on different screen sizes
- **Network-specific failures:** Works on high-speed connections but fails on mobile networks
- **Operating system failures:** Defects specific to certain OS versions

### 4. Usability and UI/UX Defects
Problems affecting user interface and interaction, making the product difficult or frustrating to use.

- **UI element failures:** Buttons, sliders, or controls unresponsive
- **Visual glitches:** Graphical errors, misaligned text, incorrect icons
- **Localization errors:** Incorrect translations or formatting for different languages
- **Inconsistent behavior:** Player behaves differently than expected
- **Navigation issues:** Users get lost or cannot find specific content/settings

### 5. Security Defects
Vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the system or user data.

- **Unauthorized content access:** Users can view unpaid content
- **Data leaks:** User data (viewing history) exposed
- **Code injection:** Malicious code execution through video player
- **Insecure third-party integrations:** API or service vulnerabilities

### 6. Content Metadata Defects
Problems related to data describing the video content.

- **Incorrect metadata:** Wrong title, description, or other details
- **Missing thumbnail:** Video preview image fails to load
- **Misleading information:** Title/description don't match content

### 7. Streaming-Specific Defects
Additional categories for products relying on video streaming.

- **Adaptive bitrate (ABR) failures:** Player fails to switch quality based on network conditions
- **Manifest/playlist errors:** Malformed or missing manifest files (M3U8, MPD)
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network) issues:** Cannot retrieve content from CDN
- **Streaming protocol errors:** Issues with HLS, DASH, or RTMP protocols
